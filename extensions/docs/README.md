# AEPsych extensions — docs

This folder contains the canonical, high-level documentation for the `extensions/` umbrella in this repository.

Purpose:

- Provide a clear, short entry point for contributors and maintainers.
- Explain how the subprojects inside `extensions/` are organized and how to develop/ test them.

What you'll find here:

- `INDEX.md` — human-friendly content index
- `SUBMODULES.md` — concise descriptions of the primary subprojects (custom_mean, custom_likelihood, etc.)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — guidance for contribution, tests, and packaging
- `README_RESOURCES.txt` — quick links to important top-level docs

These files were created to replace older scattered/duplicated files and provide a single source-of-truth for extension-level documentation.
